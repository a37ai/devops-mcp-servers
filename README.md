# DevOps MCP Servers

This repository is a collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations specifically designed for DevOps tools and platforms. These servers enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact directly with popular DevOps systems, providing a standardized way to automate and control infrastructure, deployment pipelines, monitoring, and other DevOps operations.

Each MCP server implementation provides a comprehensive set of tools that map to the respective DevOps platform's API, allowing LLMs to perform complex operations through simple function calls.
